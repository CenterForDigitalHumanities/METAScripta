#METAScripta

http://lib.slu.edu/digital-humanities/projects

METAScripta is a product of the Vatican Film Library and the Center for 
Digital Humanities at Saint Louis University. This project that will
provide open interactive access and extended life to the collection of 
pre-modern manuscripts from the Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana (BAV) 
preserved on microfilm at the Knights of Columbus Vatican Film Library (VFL),
a unit of Special Collections in the Saint Louis University Libraries. Over
37,000 BAV manuscripts on 10,000 reels of microfilm will be digitized and
made freely available through an online resource that will create
unprecedented access to these manuscripts. Presently these manuscripts are
captured on deteriorating microfilms, made primarily in the 1950s, that
are accessible only for on-site use in the VFL. Within three years, however,
the VFL microfilm collection will be rapidly scanned and reformatted into
a linked open data environment that will also enable crowdsourced metadata
contributions to encourage and support both user access and scholarly research.
METAscripta will result in an online reference resource that extends the 
life of the VFL microfilm collection, renders BAV manuscript images and 
metadata fully discoverable and freely accessible, and provides an ongoing
digital environment to facilitate the study of primary manuscript sources 
in the humanities long into the future.

##Technical Details
METAscripta will directly complement and significantly advance the efforts
of a related project undertaken by the BAV, known as Digita Vaticana,
through which the Vatican Library intends to digitize its entire collection
of more than 80,000 pre-modern manuscripts from the originals. Begun six
years ago, this project has digitized 4,415 manuscripts to date. But even
at the present accelerated rate it could take the BAV many decades simply
to complete the digitization of its collection and require much more time
than that to provide the descriptive metadata for these materials.
Historically, the BAV has lacked the cataloging necessary to allow full 
access to its extensive collections. METAscripta, however, will create a 
powerful research tool for scholars worldwide in three significant ways:
(1) by making digital images of BAV manuscripts rapidly and freely available,
it will give the broadest possible access to these materials without
restrictions, many years before the BAV will have completed its own
digitization program; (2) by providing a user interface with access to each 
page/folio image of a manuscript, it will facilitate an innovative crowdsourced 
approach to metadata input that will allow users both to contribute descriptive 
information that is lacking and to access information that has been added about
texts, paleography, illumination, and other features; and (3) by utilizing the
Open Annotation Collaboration (OAC) framework and the IIIF data environment, 
including the Mirador image viewer, it will create a nimble digital resource 
to host ongoing scholarly discourse about the manuscripts.
